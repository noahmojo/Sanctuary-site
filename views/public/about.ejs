        <p>This sanctuary exists to interrupt that pattern by offering lifelong care shaped around what animals actually need: stability, predictability, companionship, and respect for their limits.</p>
        <p>We are intentionally small. This is not a petting zoo or a production farm. Animals are never used for entertainment, output, or performance. When an animal arrives here, this becomes home.</p>
        <p>Beyond rescue, we create gentle opportunities for connection between animals and people, especially children and seniors. Alpacas and sheep are uniquely suited for this kind of interaction. They respond to calm, disengage from noise, and reward patience with presence.</p>

        <p>Time here is slow, quiet, and animal-led. Some animals choose to engage. Others don't. Both are respected.</p>
        <p>These moments are not structured as therapy and are never forced. They are simple shared experiences of being present. For many children, this is an introduction to boundaries and patience. For many seniors, it is companionship without expectation.</p>
